2. Project coding introduction:
This project contains three source files, there are: 
index.html, which is responsible for user interface and communication operation;
script.js, which is responsible for creating a random password of JavaScript file.
and style.css, which is responsible for the display style of HTML.

3. The method of creating random password.
The function of GeneratePassword(length) in script.js could help create a random password, which allows user to input their preferences: the length of password, uppercase, lowercase, nunbers, and symbols. It will pick up relevant characters from character string randomly and create the password as required then display in the passwordtext.

Summary:
From this homework, I learnt how to use Javascript functions to solve the problem. It is difficult to understand all the background of logic but I have improved from this practical work.
