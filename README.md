# passwordgenerator
Firstly, I used function GeneratePassword and defined the charactor range of variables: uppercase, lowercase, numbers as well as symbols, and the password should contrain all variables character.
Then I used Math.random and all.substring function to select random characters from the variables group and used "for (var i=0; i < length; i++)" function to repeat selection action which is equal times to the password length. 
Then it will show some alerts for users to remind them the components of this password.
Finally, I used passwordText to return the password to document. querySelector.

From this homework, I learnt how to use Javascript functions to solve the problem.
